## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not use `semantic-release`?

`semantic-release` is a popular project that inspired the creation of Octorelease. However it has the following limitations:

- Does not allow `version` step to be skipped
- Does not allow runs to be triggered by pull request
- Does not support signing off Git commits
- Does not support annotating Git tags

You should consider using `semantic-release` if it meets your needs, since it is well supported and more mature than Octorelease.

## Troubleshooting

TODO

## Node version requirement

It is recommended to use the latest LTS version of Node.js, but any [active or maintenance LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) version is supported. Octorelease is not guaranteed to work on the current non-LTS version.
